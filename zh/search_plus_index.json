Using TSMC's ultra-low-power 28nm advanced process with dual-core 64-bit processors for better power performance, stability and reliability. The program strives for zero threshold development and can be deployed in the user's products in the shortest time, giving the product artificial intelligence. The Kendryte K210 is located in the SoC of the AI ​​and IoT markets and is a very convenient MCU. Kendryte Chinese means surveying intelligence, while surveying intelligence is taken from surveying and searching. The main application field of this chip is in the field of Internet of Things, and it is developed in the field of Internet of Things. Therefore, this chip mainly provides artificial intelligence solutions, which are explored in the field of artificial intelligence. Machine vision Machine hearing ability Better low power vision processing speed and accuracy With convolutional artificial neural network hardware accelerator KPU, high performance convolution artificial neural network operation TSMC 28nm advanced process, temperature range -40 ° C to 125 ° C, stable and reliable Support firmware encryption, it is difficult to crack using common methods Unique programmable IO array for more flexible product design Low voltage, lower power consumption compared to systems with the same processing power 3.3V/1.8V dual voltage support, no level shifting, cost saving AI Solution Machine Vision With machine vision capabilities, the Kendryte K210 is a zero-threshold machine vision embedded solution. It can perform convolutional neural network calculations in low power situations. The chip can achieve the following machine vision capabilities: General target detection based on convolutional neural network Image Classification Task Based on Convolutional Neural Network Face detection and face recognition Get the size and coordinates of the detected target in real time Get the type of detected target in real time Machine hearing The Kendryte K210 has machine hearing capabilities. The chip comes with a high-performance microphone array audio processor for real-time source orientation and beamforming. The chip can achieve the following machine hearing capabilities: Sound source orientation Sound field imaging Beamforming Voice wake up Speech Recognition Visual/Hearing Hybrid Solution The Kendryte K210 combines machine vision and machine hearing to provide even more powerful features. On the one hand, in the application, both the sound source localization and the sound field imaging can be used to assist the machine vision to track the target, and the general target detection can be used to obtain the target's orientation, and then the machine hearing aids the beamforming of the orientation. On the other hand, the direction of the person can be obtained by the image transmitted from the camera, so that the microphone array is directed to the person by beamforming. At the same time, the direction of a speaker can be determined according to the microphone array, and the camera is rotated to point to the person.

Buy from Taobao official can ask if it is included, most of the current Android machines are also using Type C cable Screen By default, the LCD (24pin interface) of the st7789 driver chip is used with a resolution of 320x240. Buy from Taobao official can ask if it contains Camera Use ov2640 by default Buy from Taobao official can ask if it contains Micro SD Card (TF Card) (optional) Not applicable SD card can also manipulate files. Some of the internal Flash has been reserved as a file system, but Flash is very slow! In order to facilitate the quick operation of the picture file, you can choose to purchase a Micro SD card, MaixPy has built-in SPI SD card protocol driver. When purchasing, try to choose a new Micro SD card with fast speed, such as SD 2 generation protocol, Class10 memory card. Of course, the quality of SD cards on the market is uneven, and the SPI mode may not be compatible. Try to buy a regular card. Or maybe you should customize the driver code ~~ As shown below, the two cards on the left are not supported by the MaixPy driver. Both the middle and the right are supported, but the class10 card in the middle is the fastest. ST-Link (used to update the firmware of the STM32 on the development board Maix Go) (optional) If you purchase Maix Go, it integrates a STM32 chip to simulate the 'USB to serial' tool, and simulate JTAG. If you want to update its firmware later, it is recommended to buy a ST-Link Spare JTAG Debugger (optional) K210 This chip supports JTAG debugging. If you need debugging function, you need to use JTAG debugger. Please consult the official Sipeed Taobao shop. If you are a Maix Go development board, you don't need to purchase the JTAG debugger separately. The Max Go development board has an integrated STM32 chip that can emulate JTAG (STM32 uses CMSIS-DAP or open-ec firmware), open-ec firmware is not currently supported, will be supported later, please refer to the open-ec github project home page description "},"get_started/install.html":{"url":"get_started/install.html","title":"Install","keywords":"","body":"Install Arduino Environment Linux 1.

Syntax digitalRead(pin) Parameters pin : the number of the digital pin you want to read. Returns HIGH or LOW Notes and Warnings Only pins that are set to the input function by the pinMode() can be read. digitalWrite() Description Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin. Syntax digitalWrite(pin, value) Parameters pin: the pin number value: HIGH or LOW Returns Nothing Notes and Warnings Only pins that are set to the output function by the pinMode() can be write. pinMode() Description Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output.
